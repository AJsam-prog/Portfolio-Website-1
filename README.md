# About
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my first portfolio project! This project features a responsive website created to display images, links, and descriptions in a visually appealing manner.

# Files and Programs I Used
Here's a list of files and programs used in this project:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
- `main.css` (in the `css` folder): The CSS file containing styles for the website's layout and design.
- `Gruntfile.js`: Grunt configuration file used for task automation.
- `img` folder: Contains images used in the portfolio website.
